Ballistic eyewear is a form of glasses or goggles that protect from small projectiles and fragments. Ballistic eyewear is commercially available for anyone who wishes to buy it.  For the U.S. military, choices are listed on the Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL).). The history of protective eyewear goes back to 1880 and extends through to World War I and the present. There are three standards that are currently used to test the effectiveness of ballistic eyewear.  These include a U.S. civilian standard (ANSI Z87.1 â€“ 2010), a U.S. military standard (MIL-PRF-31013), and a European standard (EN166, 169, 170 & 172).
