A  washing machine (laundry machine, clothes washer, or washer) is a machine used to wash laundry, such as clothing and bed sheets.
The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to dry cleaning (which uses alternative cleaning fluids, and is performed by specialist businesses) or ultrasonic cleaners.
