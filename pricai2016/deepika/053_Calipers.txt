A caliper (spelling also calliper, or in plurale tantum sense a pair of calipers) is a device used to measure the distance between two opposite sides of an object.
A caliper can be as simple as a compass compass with inward or outward-facing points.
The tips of the caliper are adjusted to fit across the points to be measured, the caliper is then removed and the distance read by measuring between the tips with a measuring tool, such as a ruler.
It is used in many fields  such as mechanical engineering, metalworking, forestry, woodworking, science and medicine.
