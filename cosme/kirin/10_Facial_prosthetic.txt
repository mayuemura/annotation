A facial prosthetic or facial prosthesis is an artificial device used to change or adapt the outward appearance of a person's face or head.
When used in the theatre, film or television industry, facial prosthetic makeup alters a person's normal face into something extraordinary. 
Facial prosthetics can be made from a wide range of materials - including latex, foam latex, silicone, and cold foam. 
Effects can be as subtle as altering the curve of a cheek or nose, or making someone appear older or younger than they are. 
A facial prosthesis can also transform an actor into any creature, such as mythical creatures, animals and others.
