Liquorice, or licorice is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra from which a sweet flavour can be extracted.
The liquorice plant is a herbaceous perennial legume native to southern Europe, India, and parts of Asia.
It is not botanically related to anise, star anise, or fennel, which are sources of similar flavouring compounds.
Most liquorice is used as a flavouring agent for tobacco, particularly American blend cigarettes, to which liquorice lends a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour and makes it easier to inhale the smoke by creating bronchodilators, which open up the lungs.
Liquorice flavours are also used as candies or sweeteners, particularly in some European and Middle Eastern countries.
