Prenatal vitamins are vitamin and mineral supplements intended to be taken before and during pregnancy and during postnatal lactation.  Although not intended to replace a healthy diet, prenatal vitamins provide women of child bearing age with nutrients recognized by the various health organizations including the American Dietetic Association as helpful for a healthy pregnancy outcome. It may be appropriate to start taking prenatal vitamins once the female enters childbearing age.
