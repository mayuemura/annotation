A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.
The term "laser" originated as an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation".
The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow.
A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherence coherently.
Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography.
