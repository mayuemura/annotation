A tea strainer is a type of strainer that is placed over or in a teacup to catch loose tea leaves.
When tea is brewed in the traditional manner in a teapot, the tea leaves are not contained in teabags, but rather are freely suspended in the water.
As the leaves themselves may be distasteful, it is usual to filter filter them out with a tea strainer.
Strainers usually fit into the top of the cup to catch the leaves as the tea is poured.
Some deeper tea strainers can also be used to brew single cups of tea, much as teabags or brewing baskets are used - the strainer full of leaves is set in a cup to brew the tea, and then removed, along with the spent tea leaves, when the tea is ready to drink.
