Bromelain is a protein extract derived from the stems of pineapples, although it exists in all parts of the fresh plant and fruit.
The extract has a history of folk medicine use.
As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a meat tenderizer.
The term "bromelain" may refer to either of two protease enzymes extracted from the plants of the family Bromeliaceae, or it may refer to a combination of those enzymes along with other compounds produced in an extract.
Although tested in a variety of research models for its possible efficacy against diseases, bromelain has no established research evidence as a nutraceutical or drug.
