A hammer is a tool that delivers a blow (a sudden impact) to an object. Most
hammers are hand tools used to drive nails, fit parts, forge metal, and break
apart objects. Hammers vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their
purposes.
Hammers are basic tools in many trades. The usual features are a head (most
often made of steel) and a handle (also called a helve or haft). Most hammers
are hand tools, but there are also many powered versions, called power hammers
(such as steam hammers and trip hammers) for heavier uses, such as forging.
Some hammers have other names, such as sledgehammer, mallet and gavel. The
term "hammer" also applies to some other devices that deliver blows, such as
the hammer of a firearm or the hammer of a piano.
