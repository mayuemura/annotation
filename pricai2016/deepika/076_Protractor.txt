A protractor is a measuring instrument, typically made of transparent plastic or glass, for measuring angles.
Most protractors measure angles indegree degrees (Â°).
Radian-scale protractors measure angles in radians.
Most protractors are divided into 180 equal parts.
They are used for a variety of mechanical and engineering-related applications, but perhaps the most common use is in geometry lessons in schools.
