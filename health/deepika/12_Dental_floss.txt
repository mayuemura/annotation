Dental floss is a cord of thin filaments used to remove food and dental plaque from between teeth in areas a toothbrush is unable to reach.
It has been widely accepted that the use of floss has a favourable effect on plaque removal and disease prevention, and the American Dental Association reports that up to 80% of plaque can be eliminated with this method.
However, several reviews have failed to find any clear benefit over toothbrushing alone.
