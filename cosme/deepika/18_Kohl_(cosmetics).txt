Kohl is an ancient eye cosmetic, traditionally made by grinding stibnite (Sb2S3). 
It is widely used in South Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, and parts of West Africa as eyeliner to contour and/or darken the eyelids and as mascara for the eyelashes. 
It is worn mostly by women, but also by some men and children.
Kohl has also been used in India as a cosmetic for a long time. 
In addition, mothers would apply kohl to their infants' eyes soon after birth.
