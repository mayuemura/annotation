A domestic ice cream maker is a machine used to make small quantities of ice cream for personal consumption.
Ice cream makers may prepare the mixture by employing the hand-cranking method or by employing an electric motor.
The resulting preparation is often chilled through either pre-cooling the machine or by employing a machine that freezes the mixture.
An ice cream maker has to simultaneously freeze the mixture while churning it so as to aerate the mixture and avoid ice crystals.
As a result, most ice creams are ready to consume immediately.
