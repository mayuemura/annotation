A telescope is an instrument that aids in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light).
The first known practical telescopes were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, using glass lenses.
They found use in terrestrial applications and astronomy.
Within a few decades, the reflecting telescope was invented, which used mirrors.
In the 20th century many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s.
