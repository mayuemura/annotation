An antifungal medication is a pharmaceutical fungicide used to treat and prevent mycoses such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (thrush), serious systemic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, and others.
Such drugs are usually obtained by a doctor's prescription, but a few are available OTC (over-the-counter).
