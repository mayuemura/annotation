Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion that is used in the nutrition of larvae, as well as adult queens.
It is secreted from the glands in the Insect hypopharynx of worker bees, and fed to all larvae in the colony, regardless of sex or caste.
When worker bees decide to make a new queen, because the old one is either weakening or dead, they choose several small larvae and feed them with copious amounts of royal jelly in specially constructed queen cells.
This type of feeding triggers the development of queen morphology morphology, including the fully developed ovaries needed to lay eggs.
