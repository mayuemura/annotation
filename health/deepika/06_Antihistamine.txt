An antihistamine is a type of pharmaceutical drug that opposes the activity of histamine receptors in the body.
Antihistamines are subclassified according to the histamine receptor that they act upon: the two largest classes of antihistamines are H1-antihistamines and H2-antihistamines.
Antihistamines that target the histamine H1-receptor are used to treat allergic reactions in the nose (e.g., itching, runny nose, and sneezing) as well as for insomnia.
