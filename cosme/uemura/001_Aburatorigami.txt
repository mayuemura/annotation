Nihongo|Aburatorigami|あぶらとり紙 is a traditional Japanese facial oil blotting paper.
The direct translation of the term is "oil removal paper". 
As the term implies, aburatorigami absorbs excess oil, thereby eliminating shine from the face.
Aburatorigami has traditionally been used by kabuki actors and geisha to keep makeup looking fresh throughout performances. 
In modern times it has been growing in popularity for everyday use amongst women for its various skincare and makeup benefits.
