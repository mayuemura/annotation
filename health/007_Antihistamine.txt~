An antihistamine is a type of pharmaceutical drug that opposes the activity of histamine receptors in the body. Antihistamines are subclassified according to the histamine receptor that they act upon: the two largest classes of antihistamines are H1 antagonist|H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines and H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-antihistamines. Antihistamines that target the HRH1|histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor are used to treat allergic rhinitis|allergic reactions in the nose (e.g., itching, runny nose, and sneezing) as well as for insomnia. They are sometimes also used to treat motion sickness or vertigo caused by problems with the inner ear.  Antihistamines that target the HRH2|histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor are used to treat gastric acid conditions (e.g., peptic ulcers and acid reflux). H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines work by binding to HRH1|histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors in mast cells, smooth muscle, and endothelium in the body as well as in the tuberomammillary nucleus in the brain; H<sub>2</sub>-antihistamines bind to HRH2|histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptors in the upper Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the stomach.

Histamine receptors exhibit constitutive activity, so antihistamines can function as either a neutral receptor antagonist or an inverse agonist at histamine receptor.Importantly, because antihistamines can theoretically behave as inverse agonists or neutral antagonists, they are more properly described as H1-antihistamines rather than H1-receptor antagonists.15</ref> Only a few currently marketed H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines are known to function as inverse agonists.
