Coenzyme Q10, also known as ubiquinone, ubidecarenone, coenzyme Q, and abbreviated at times to CoQ10 IPAc-en|ˌ|k|oʊ|_|ˌ|k|juː|_|ˈ|t|ɛ|n, CoQ, or Q10 is a 1,4-benzoquinone, where Q refers to the quinone chemical group, and 10 refers to the number of isoprene|isoprenyl chemical subunits in its tail.

This oil-soluble, vitamin-like substance is present in most Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells, primarily in the mitochondria. It is a component of the electron transport chain and participates in Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic cellular respiration, generating energy in the form of Adenosine triphosphate|ATP. Ninety-five percent of the human body’s energy is generated this way. Therefore, those organs with the highest energy requirements—such as the heart, liver and kidney—have the highest CoQ10 concentrations. There are three redox states of CoQ10: fully oxidized (ubiquinone), semiquinone (ubisemiquinone), and fully Organic redox reaction|reduced (ubiquinol). The capacity of this molecule to exist in a completely oxidized form and a completely reduced form enables it to perform its functions in the electron transport chain, and as an antioxidant, respectively.
