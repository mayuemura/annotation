An adhesive bandage, also called a sticking plaster (or simply plaster) in British English, is a small dressing (medical)|medical dressing used for injuries not serious enough to require a full-size bandage.
They are also known by the genericized trademarks Band-Aid (as "band-aid" or "band aid" in the US) or Elastoplast (in the UK).
