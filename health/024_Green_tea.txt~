Green tea is made from Camellia sinensis leaves that have undergone minimal Tea processing|oxidation during processing.

Preliminary research on many of these claims is promising, but many also require further study to evaluate.

Daily consumption of black tea (but not green tea) has been associated with a significant reduction in death from all cancers. There is limited evidence to suggest that green tea consumption may be associated with a slightly lower risk of esophageal cancer in the Chinese population, a lower risk of lung cancer in women, and a lower risk of oral cancer in Asian people. Similarly, another analysis of observational data conducted in 2012 suggested that green tea consumption may have a favorable effect on lung cancer risk. The observed effect was strongest in those who consumed more than seven cups of green tea daily. A 2013 Cochrane library|Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials concluded that green tea consumption for 3â€“6 months appears to lower Blood pressure|systolic and diastolic blood pressures a small amount (about 3 mmHg each).
