Varnish is a transparent, hard, protective finish or film that is primarily used in wood finishing but also for other materials.
Varnish is traditionally a combination of a drying oil, a resin, and a thinner or solvent.
Varnish finishes are usually glossy but may be designed to produce satin or semi-gloss sheens by the addition of "flatting" agents.
Varnish has little or no color, is transparent, and has no added pigment, as opposed to paints or wood stains, which contain pigment and generally range from opaque to translucent.
Varnishes are also applied over wood stains as a final step to achieve a film for gloss and protection.
