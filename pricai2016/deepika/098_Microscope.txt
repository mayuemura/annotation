A microscope is an instrument used to see objects that are too small for the naked eye.
The science of investigating small objects using such an instrument is called microscopy.
Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.
There are many types of microscopes.
The most common (and the first to be invented) is the optical microscope, which uses light to image the sample.
