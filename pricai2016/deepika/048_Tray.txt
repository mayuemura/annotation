A tray is a shallow platform designed for carrying Object things.
It can be fashioned from numerous materials, including silver, brass, sheet iron, paperboard, wood, melamine, and molded pulp.
Trays range in cost from inexpensive molded pulp trays which are disposable, to inexpensive melamine trays used in cafeterias, to mid-priced wooden trays used in a home, to expensive silver trays used in luxury hotels.
Some examples have raised galleries, handles, and short feet for support.
Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off of them.
