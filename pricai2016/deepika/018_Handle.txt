A handle is a part of, or attachment to, an object that can be moved or used by hand.
The design of each type of handle involves substantial ergonomic issues, even where these are dealt with intuitively or by following tradition.
Handles for tools are an important part of their function, enabling the user to exploit the tools to maximum effect.
