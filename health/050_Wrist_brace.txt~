A  wrist brace  is a garment that is worn around the wrist to protect it during strong use or for allowing it to heal. They immobilize the joint and provide heat and compression to the wrist bones and ligaments. Currently, they are made with a rigid tissue nylon fabrics In these cases, using pressure around the wrist may prevent sprains and strains.

Finally, are used in sports which force the wrist play, as those played with a paddle or racket (tennis, paddle, badminton) or hockey. Some times they have a double purpose: protect the wrist from injuries and wipe the sweat from the forehead. For this purpose are made in absorbent materials such as cotton or plush.

In artistic gymnastics, gymnasts will sometimes wear wrist guards, often referred to as 'Panda Paws' to absorb the impact on the skills they perform. The guards are commonly worn for Vaulting and Floor exercises. The design is modified between women and men.
