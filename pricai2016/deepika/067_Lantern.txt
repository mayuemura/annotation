A lantern is a portable lighting device or mounted fixture used to illuminate areas.
Lanterns may also be used for signaling, as torches, or as general light sources outdoors.
Low light level varieties are used for decoration.
The term "lantern" is also used more generically to mean a light source, or the enclosure for a light source.
Examples are glass pane enclosed street lights, or the housing for the top lamp and lens section of a lighthouse.
