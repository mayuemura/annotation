A food processor is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate repetitive tasks in the preparation of food.
Today, the term almost always refers to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual devices also referred to as "food processors".
Food processors are similar to blenders in many ways.
The primary difference is that food processors use interchangeable blades and disks (attachments) instead of a fixed blade.
Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more appropriate shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in a food processor.
