Genetically modified crops (GMCs, GM crops, or biotech crops) are plants used in agriculture, the DNA of which has been modified using genetic engineering techniques.
In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species.
Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, or resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a herbicide), or improving the nutrient profile of the crop.
Examples in non-food crops include production of Plant manufactured pharmaceutical agents, biofuels, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for bioremediation.
10% of the world's arable land was planted with GM crops in 2010.
