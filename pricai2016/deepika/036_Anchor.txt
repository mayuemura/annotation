An anchor is a device, normally made of metal, used to connect a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current.
The word derives from Latin ancora, which itself comes from the Greek ἄγκυρα (ankura).
Anchors can either be temporary or permanent.
Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring (watercraft) mooring, and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them.
Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights.A sea anchor is a drogue, not in contact with the seabed, used to control a drifting vessel.
