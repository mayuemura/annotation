A coaster, drink coaster, beverage coaster, or beermat is an item used to rest beverages upon.
Coasters protect the surface of a Table table or any other surface where the user might place a beverage.
Public houses usually will have beermats spread out across their tables.
They are used not just to protect the surface of the table, but, as they are usually made  of paper, they can also be used to absorb condensation dripping along the glass or serve as an ad-hoc notepad.
Beermats are often branded with trademarks or alcohol advertising.
