Hibiscus tea is a herbal tea made as an infusion from crimson or deep magenta-coloured calyces (sepals) of the Roselle (plant)|roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) flower. It is consumed both hot and cold.

It has a tart, cranberry-like flavour, and sugar is often added to sweeten it. The tea contains vitamin C and dietary mineral|minerals and is used traditionally as a mild medicine. In west Sudan a white hibiscus flower is favoured for its bitter taste and is customarily served to guests.
Hibiscus tea contains 15-30% organic acids, including citric acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid. It also contains acidic polysaccharides and flavonoid glycosides, such as cyanidin and delphinidin, that give it its characteristic deep red colour.

The drink is called roselle (a name for the flower) or rosella (Australia); agua de Jamaica and/or flor de Jamaica in Latin America; Arhul ka phool in India; karkad√© in Levant, Egypt, Sudan, Italy and Post-Soviet states; Chai Kujarat in Iraq; Chai Torsh in Iran; gumamela in the Philippines; bissap, tsoborodo or wonjo in West Africa; sorrel in Jamaica, Belize, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago; red sorrel in the wider Caribbean; and other names in other regions, including the U.S., where it is sometimes known simply as Jamaica.
