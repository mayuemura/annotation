Cucumber juice is the juice derived from cucumbers that may by produced by placing pressure on the vegetable by pressing or squeezing it. Cucumber juice has a high water content, as cucumbers have a 98% water content. Cucumber juice produced in a juicer typically has a significant amount of the vegetable's pulp. Straining juice produced in this manner can reduce pulp content. Cucumber juice may be used as an ingredient in the preparation of beverages such as smoothies, cocktails such as the Bloody Mary, dishes such as cucumber soup, and in dips and salad dressings, such as green goddess dressing. It is also used topically and in many types of topical products, such as lotions, creams and soaps.
