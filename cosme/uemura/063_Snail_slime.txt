Snail slime is a kind of mucus, an external bodily secretion which is produced by snails, gastropod mollusks. 
Land snails  and slugs produce mucus, but so does every other kind of gastropod, from marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. 
The reproductive system of gastropods also produces mucus internally from special glands.
Externally, one kind of mucus is produced by the foot of the gastropod and is usually used for crawling on. 
The other kind of external mucus is designed to coat the external parts of the gastropod's body; in land species this coating helps prevent desiccation of the exposed soft tissues.
