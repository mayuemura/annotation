Caulking is both the processes and material (also called sealant) to seal joints or seams in various structures and some types of piping.
The oldest form of caulking is used to make the seams in wooden boats or ships watertight, by driving fibrous materials into the wedge-shaped seams between boards.
A related process was formerly employed to join sections of cast iron sewerage pipe.
Caulking is also the term  to describe the process used to make riveted iron or steel ships and boilers watertight or steamtight.
The same term also refers to the application of flexible sealing compounds to close up gaps in buildings and other structures against water, air, dust, insects, or as a component in firestopping.
