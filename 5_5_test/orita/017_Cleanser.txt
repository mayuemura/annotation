A cleanser is a Face|facial care product that is used to remove make-up, dead skin|skin cells, oil, dirt, and other types of pollutants from the skin of the face. This helps to unclog Sweat pore|pores and prevent skin conditions such as Acne vulgaris|acne. A cleanser can be used as part of a skin care regimen together with a toner (skin care)|toner and moisturizer.

Using a cleanser to remove dirt is considered to be a better alternative to bar soap or another form of skin cleanser not specifically formulated for the face for the following reasons:
* Bar soap has a high pH (in the area of 9 to 10), and the skin's surface pH is on average 4.7. This means that soap can change the balance present in the skin to favor the overgrowth of some types of bacteria, increasing acne. 
* Bar cleansers have thickeners that allow them to assume a bar shape. These thickeners can clog pores, leading to acne.Citation needed|date=May 2008
* Using bar soap on the face can remove natural oils from the skin that form a barrier against water loss. This causes the sebaceous glands to subsequently overproduce oil, a condition known as reactive seborrhoea, which will lead to clogged pores.Citation needed|date=May 2008 In order to prevent drying out the skin, many cleansers incorporate moisturizers.
