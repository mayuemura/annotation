Setting spray (also finishing spray, makeup setting spray, finish spray, or makeup spray) is a cosmetics|cosmetic product designed to preserve applied make-up long periods of time. 
Usually sold in small spray bottles, setting spray is applied by spritzing mist over the face, keeping the make-up application moist for several hours. 
The product, called Makeup Finishing Spray, gained popularity in Hollywood, where it was used on programs such as Project Runway and Dancing With The Stars. 
Many celebrities adopted the use of setting sprays as well. 
Since Skindinavia's launch, many other setting sprays have entered the market, including products made by Eyes Lips Face (J.A. Cosmetics Corp), Matrix (cosmetics) | Matrix, and Sephora (cosmetics) | Sephora.
