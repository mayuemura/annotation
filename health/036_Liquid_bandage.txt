Liquid bandage is a topical skin treatment for minor cuts  and sores that is sold by several companies. The products are mixtures of chemicals which create a polymeric layer which binds to the skin. This protects the wound by keeping dirt and germs out, and keeping moisture in. These products protect the wound by forming a thin film of polymer when the carrier evaporates. Polymers used may include polyvinylpyrrolidone (water based), pyroxylin/nitrocellulose or poly(methylacrylate-isobutene-monoisopropylmaleate) (alcohol based), and Acrylate polymer|acrylate or siloxane polymers (hexamethyldisiloxane or isooctane solvent based).

In addition to their use in replacing conventional bandages in minor cuts  and scrapes, they have found use in surgical and veterinary offices, as they cause less trauma, and do not have to be removed like sutures (stitches) and Surgical staple|staples do. Liquid bandages are increasingly finding use in the field of combat, where they can be used to rapidly stanch a wound until proper medical attention can be obtained.
