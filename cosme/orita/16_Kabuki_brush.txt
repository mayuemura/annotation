A kabuki brush (sometimes called mushroom brush) is a makeup brush with a short stem and dense bristles. 
The brush head is most often rounded, though it can be also flat. 
Traditionally, the bristles are made of natural materials like animal hair (e.g., goat or horse hair), but most brushes available now on the market have synthetic bristles.
