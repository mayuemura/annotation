Kava or kava-kava (Piper Piper methysticum: Latin  "pepper" + Latinized Ancient Greek "intoxicating") is a crop of the western Pacific Pacific.
The name kava(-kava) is from Tongan and Marquesan; other names for kava include okinaawa (Hawaiokinai), ava (Samoa), yaqona (Fiji), sakau (Pohnpei), and malok or malogu (parts of Vanuatu).
The roots of the plant are used to produce a drink with sedative and anesthetic properties.
Kava is consumed throughout the Pacific Ocean cultures of Polynesia, including Hawaii, Vanuatu, Melanesia and some parts of Micronesia.(See canoe plants.)
Kava is sedating and is primarily consumed to relax without disrupting mental clarity.
