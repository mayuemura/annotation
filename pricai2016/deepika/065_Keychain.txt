A keychain or key chain is a small chain, usually made from metal or plastic, that connects a small item to a keyring.
The length of a keychain allows an item to be used more easily than if connected directly to a keyring.
Some keychains allow one or both ends the ability to rotate, keeping the keychain from becoming twisted, while the item is being used.
A keychain can also be a connecting link between a keyring and the belt belt of an individual.
It is usually employed by personnel whose job demands frequent use of keys, such as a security guard, prison officer, janitor, or retail store manager.
