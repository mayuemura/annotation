An earring is a piece of jewellery attached to the ear via a piercing in the earlobe or another external part of the ear (except in the case of clip earrings, which clip onto the lobe).
Earrings are worn by both sexes, although more common among women, and have been used by different civilizations in different times.
Locations for piercings other than the earlobe include the rook, tragus, and across the helix (see image at right).
The simple term "ear piercing" usually refers to an earlobe piercing, whereas piercings in the upper part of the Pinna external ear are often referred to as "cartilage piercings".
Cartilage piercings are more complex to perform than earlobe piercings and take longer to heal.
