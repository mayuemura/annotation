A coffee filter is a coffee-brewing utensil, usually made of disposable paper.
This enables it to trap the coffee grounds and allow the liquid coffee to flow through.
Paper filters remove oily components called diterpenes; these organic compounds, present in unfiltered coffee are known to be antimicrobial and antiinflammatory.
Metal or nylon mesh filters do not remove these components.
