Deep ocean minerals (DOM) are mineral nutrients (chemical elements) extracted from deep ocean water (DOW) found at ocean depths of between 250 and 1500 meters.  DOW contains over 70 mineral nutrients and trace elements including magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) in their bio ionic form. To extract these products, DOW is treated with micro filtration and reverse osmosis to Desalination|desalinate and concentrate magnesium, other minerals and trace elements whilst eliminating the salt (sodium chloride).

Although research about DOM is in its early stages, as it is a source of electrolytes that can help metabolize carbohydrate, proteins and fat plus maintain bone, teeth and muscle function, health benefits are possible. 

The abundance of minerals and trace elements is also of note as deficiencies in macro minerals and micro trace elements can lead to premature aging, immune dysfunction and susceptibility to cardiovascular related diseases.

The minerals and trace elements (DOM) present in DOW have three important functions:

#Provide the structure to our organs, tissues and bones â€“ calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, fluorine and sulfur.
#The electrolyte form facilitates body fluid activity in tissues to maintain fluid balance, acid-base balance, membrane permeability, tissue irritability (including nerve transmission and muscle contraction) - sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and magnesium in blood, all present in DOMs.
#Magnesium alone, potentially catalyses up to 600 enzyme and hormone reactions.
