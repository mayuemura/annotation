A heat gun is a device used to emit a stream of hot air, usually at temperatures between 100°C and 550°C (200-1000°F), with some hotter models running around 760°C (1400°F), which can be held by hand.
Heat guns usually have the form of an elongated body pointing at what is to be heated, with a handle fixed to it at right angles and a Trigger trigger, in the same general layout as a handgun, hence the name.
