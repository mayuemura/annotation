A mask is an object normally worn on the face, typically for protection, disguise, performance or entertainment.
Masks have been used since antiquity for both ceremonial and practical purposes.
They are usually worn on the face, although they may also be positioned for effect elsewhere on the wearer's body.
In parts of Australia, giant totem masks cover the body, whilst Inuit women use finger masks during storytelling and dancing.
