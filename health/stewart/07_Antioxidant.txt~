An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the oxidation of other molecules.
Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons which can produce free radicals.
In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions.
When the chain reaction occurs in a cell, it can cause damage or death to the cell.
Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions.
