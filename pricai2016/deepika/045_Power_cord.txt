A power cord, line cord, or mains cable is a cable that temporarily connects an electrical appliance to the mains electricity supply via a wall socket or extension cord.
The terms are generally used for cables using a AC power plug to connect to a single-phase alternating current power source at the local line voltage&mdash;(generally 100 to 240 volts, depending on the location).
The terms power cable, mains lead, flex or kettle lead are also used.
A lamp cord (also known as a zip cord) is a light-weight, ungrounded, single-insulated two-wire cord used for small loads such as a table or floor lamp.
A cord set includes connectors molded to the cord at each end (see Appliance coupler).
