A nasal strip, external nasal dilator strip or nasal dilator strip is a type of adhesive bandage with embedded plastic ribs or splints that is applied across the Nasal bone|bridge of the nose and sides of the nostrils, to assist in keeping the airway open. They are believed to make breathing easier and for that reason are used by humans during athletic exertion and as an aid to reduce congestion or to prevent snoring. They have no reported side effects other than possible skin irritation from the adhesive.

Studies indicate that they are useful in increasing nasal cavity volume in the front three centimeters of the human nose, and for that purpose could be an alternative to Nasal spray|decongestive nose sprays, but nasal strips are not particularly helpful for congestion in the posterior nasal apertures.  However, their primary benefit is to prevent bleeding in the lungs (EIPH), not to directly enhance performance.  The equine version was invented by two veterinarians, James Chiapetta and Edward Blach.  In the 1990s, they were inspired by the human product to attempt to create a similar device for horses.  They had observed horses on treadmills and saw that, under exertion, the equine nasal passage also narrowed due to the tissue being sucked in. They worked out a licensing agreement with CNS, the company that manufacturerd the human "Breath Right" brand of nasal strips in 1997 (now owned by GlaxoSmithKline) where the company manufactured the equine form of the nasal strip, and paid royalties to Chiapetta and Blach.  The equine version was first used publicly at the 1999 Breeders' Cup horse races and the 2000 Summer Olympics.  In 2001, they parted ways with CNS and formed their own company, Flair, and in 2008, Chiapetta bought out Blach.<!--this cite to all of paragraph following previous footnote-->
