A hand antiseptic,

Despite common perceptions, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are well-adapted to the skin.citation needed|date=March 2012 Also, use of alcohol-based hand gels dries skin less, leaving more moisture in the Epidermis (skin)|epidermis, than hand washing with antiseptic/antimicrobial soap and water. Isopropyl alcohol will kill 99.99 percent or more of all non-spore forming bacteria in less than 30 seconds, both in the laboratory and on human skin.

For health care settings like hospitals and clinics, optimum alcohol concentration to kill bacteria is 70% to 95%. Products with alcohol concentrations as low as 40% are available in American stores, according to researchers at East Tennessee State University.

Not all forms of bacterial pathogens are equally susceptible.  Certain spores of endospore forming bacteria, especially the endospores of gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Clostridium difficile) are relatively resistant to sanitizers and soap and water and remain biologically viable after their use. During the 2001 anthrax attacks on the United States Postal Service, authorities warned that alcohol hand rubs and soap and water would not kill anthrax endospores but they will kill the anthrax bacteria.

Some medical opinions question the effectiveness of alcohol-based hand sanitizers for preventing influenza.  Arthur Reingold, vaccine specialist who has advised for the WHO, worries that "in the determination to tell people what they can do to protect themselves, people pooh-pooh things like masks, which really are effective against influenza, and are reluctant to get vaccinated." He claims that "washing hands really is wonderful for preventing many diseases, such as the common cold, but it's not very helpful to prevent influenza, [and that] studies done 40 and 50 years ago pretty much show it's impossible to get influenza through hand-to-hand contact". Instead, he says that "you must breathe the virus [right] into your lungs". For example, research into the transmission of influenza from swine to humans has shown a statistically significant reduction in transmission if the handler wears gloves when working with sick animals, therefore implying that there is a distinct danger of catching the influenza virus via hand-to-face transmission. That opinion is shared by US Public Health, CDC and WHO officials, who therefore agree that washing the hands with soap and water or the use of a hand sanitizer (and not touching eyes, nose or mouth) are important measures to help prevent the spread of influenza.

Peter Palese, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, has said that hand washing isn't all that helpful against the flu because the flu isn't like other respiratory diseases.  "The flu virus isn't very stable on the hand," he said. "The virus has a lipid membrane that flattens out when it's on your hand, and it gets inactivated." Furthermore, whereas the influenza virus can survive for only minutes on a person's hands, researchers have found that it can survive for hours (some say even days) on many other surfaces. The University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) produced a document

Laboratory studies have shown lingering benzalkonium chloride may be associated with antibiotic resistance in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA while no mechanism for resistance to alcohol has ever been described in bacteria. Where alcohol sanitizers utilize 62%, or higher, alcohol by weight, only .1 to .13% of benzalkonium chloride by weight provides equivalent antimicrobial effectiveness.

Triclosan has been shown to accumulate in biosolids in the environment, one of the top seven organic contaminants in waste water according to the National Toxicology Program Triclosan leads to various problems with natural biological systems, However, the Centers for Disease Control recommends using hand sanitizer with children to promote good hygiene, under supervision, and furthermore recommends parents pack hand sanitizer for their children when traveling, to avoid their contracting disease from dirty hands. Isopropanol, a moderate health risk, is found in some sanitizers.

There have been cases reported of people Surrogate alcohol|drinking the gel (with mixers) in prisons and hospitals to become intoxicated leading to its withdrawal from some establishments.

On April 30, 2015, the FDA announced that they were requesting more scientific data based on the safety of hand sanitizer on new scientific information. Emerging science also suggests that for at least some health care antiseptic active ingredients, systemic exposure (full body exposure as shown by detection of antiseptic ingredients in the blood or urine) is higher than previously thought, and existing data raise potential concerns about the effects of repeated daily human exposure to some antiseptic active ingredients. This would include hand antiseptic products containing alcohol and triclosan.
