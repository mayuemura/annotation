Panelling (or paneling in the U.S.) is a millwork wall covering constructed from rigid or semi-rigid components.
These are traditionally interlocking wood, but could be plastic or other materials.
Panelling was developed in antiquity to make rooms in Rock stone buildings more comfortable.
The panels served to insulate the room from the cold stone.
In more modern buildings, such panelling is often installed for decorative purposes.
