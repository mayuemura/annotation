A nasal strip, external nasal dilator strip or nasal dilator strip is a type of adhesive bandage with embedded plastic ribs or splints that is applied across the bridge of the nose and sides of the nostrils, to assist in keeping the airway open.
They are believed to make breathing easier and for that reason are used by humans during athletic exertion and as an aid to reduce congestion or to prevent snoring.
Various studies have not indicated that they have a performance-enhancing effect.
They are also used by race horse trainers on horses for similar reasons; they are thought to reduce airway resistance and lower the risk of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), plus reduce fatigue and aid post-race recovery.
