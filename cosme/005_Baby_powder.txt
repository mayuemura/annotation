Baby powder is an astringent powder (substance)|powder used for preventing diaper rash, as a deodorant, and for other cosmetic uses.  It may be composed of talc (in which case it is also called talcum powder) or corn starch.  Talcum powder is dangerous if inhaled since it may cause aspiration pneumonia or granuloma. Pediatricians generally prefer cornstarch to talc because it is unlikely to be easily inhaled.citation needed|date=August 2014 Baby powder can also be used as a shampoo, cleaning agent, and freshener.
