Echinacea (EchinaceaEchinacea IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|ɨ|ˈ|n|eɪ|ʃ|ⁱ|ə is a genus, or group of herbaceous flowering plants in the daisy family.
The Echinacea genus has nine species, which are commonly called purple coneflowers.
They are found only in eastern and central North America, where they are found growing in moist to dry prairies and open wooded areas.
They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming from early to late summer.
The generic name is derived from the Greek word ἐχῖνος (echino), meaning "sea urchin," due to the spiny central disk.
