iFood (isotopic food) contains nutritients in which some atoms are replaced with their heavier non-radioactive isotopes (such as carbon-13|<sup>13</sup>C and deuterium|<sup>2</sup>H, derived from C4 carbon fixation|C<sub>4</sub>-plants). Biomolecules that incorporate heavier isotopes give rise to more stable molecular structures with increased resistance to damages associated with ageing. The inclusion of heavy isotopes might be either active (selection for heavier isotopes) or passive (incorporation reflecting the existing abundance). Consumption of foods relatively rich in heavy isotopes, especially at the early stages of the organism's development, is linked, so far hypothetically, with enhanced longevity. Consumed with food, some biomolecules (e.g., essential amino acids) become building material for the human cells. Molecules that contain heavier isotopes are less prone to destructive effect of free radicals (which is the key point of the free-radical theory of ageing).

After publication in scientific literature, the concept of isotopic food moved onto popular science publications and even became a hot topic in mass media where the anti-ageing properties were often mistakenly attributed to heavy water.
