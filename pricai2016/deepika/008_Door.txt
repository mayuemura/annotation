A door is a moving structure used to block off, and allow access to, an entrance to or within an enclosed space, such as a building or vehicle.
Similar exterior structures are called gates.
Typically, doors have an interior side that faces the inside of a space and an exterior side that faces the outside of that space.
While in some cases the interior side of a door may match its exterior side, in other cases there are sharp contrasts between the two sides, such as in the case of the vehicle door.
Doors normally consist of a panel that swings on hinges or that slides or spins inside of a space.
