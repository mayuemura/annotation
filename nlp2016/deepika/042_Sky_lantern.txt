A sky lantern, also known as Kongming lantern or Chinese lantern, is a small hot air balloon made of paper, with an opening at the bottom where a small fire is suspended.
In Asia and elsewhere around the world, sky lanterns have been traditionally made for centuries, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities.
The name "sky lantern" is a translation of the Standard Chinese name tiān dēng (天燈, 天灯).
Sky lanterns have also been referred to as sky candles or fire balloons; the latter term, however, is also used to refer to fire balloon munitions used during World War II.
When lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air.
