An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the Redox|oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons which can produce Radical (chemistry)|free radicals.  In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions.  When the chain reaction occurs in a cell (biology)|cell, it can cause damage or death to the cell.  Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often reducing agents such as thiols, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), or polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenols. Although initial studies suggested that antioxidant supplements might promote health, later large clinical trial|trials including of beta-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations suggest that supplementation has no effect on mortality or possibly increases it.  Randomized trials of taking antioxidants including beta carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C and selenium have shown no effect on cancer risk or have increased cancer risk.  Supplementation with selenium or vitamin E does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Antioxidants also have many industrial uses, such as preservatives in food and cosmetics and to prevent the degradation of rubber and gasoline.
