A blender (sometimes called a liquidiser in British English) is a kitchen and laboratory appliance used to mix, pur√©e, or emulsify food and other substances.
A stationary blender consists of a blender jar with a rotating metal blade at the bottom, powered by an electric motor in the base.
Some powerful models can also crush ice.
The newer immersion blender configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container.
