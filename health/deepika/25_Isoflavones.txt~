Isoflavones are a type of often naturally occurring isoflavonoids, many of which act as phytoestrogens in mammals.
Some are termed antioxidants because of their ability to trap singlet oxygen.
However, the risk reduction in breast cancer from soy isoflavones was only shown in Asian populations (Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study).
