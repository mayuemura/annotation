Isoflavones are a type of often naturally occurring isoflavonoids, many of which act as phytoestrogens in mammals. Some are termed antioxidants because of their ability to trap singlet oxygen.
Isoflavones are produced almost exclusively by the members of the Fabaceae (i.e., Leguminosae, or bean) family.

Isoflavones (and closely related phytoestrogens) have grown popular as dietary supplements, but there are few studies showing any benefits from these compounds, and their use is viewed within the scientific and medical community as pseudoscience. Some studies have also identified significant risks from isoflavones.
