An anesthetic (anaesthetic or anÃ¦sthetic in British English) is a drug that causes anesthesia, which is a reversible loss of sensation.  Anesthetics contrast with analgesics (painkillers), which relieve pain without eliminating sensation. These drugs are generally administered to facilitate surgery.  A wide variety of drugs are used in modern anesthetic practice.  Many are rarely used outside of anesthesia, although others are used commonly by all disciplines.
