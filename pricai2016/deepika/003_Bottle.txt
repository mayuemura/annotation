A bottle is a rigid container with a neck that is narrower than the body and a mouth.
By contrast, a jar  has a relatively large mouth or opening which may be as wide as the overall container.
Bottles are often made of glass, clay, plastic, aluminium or other impervious materials, and typically used to store liquids such as water, milk, soft drinks, beer, wine, cooking oil, medicine, shampoo, ink, and chemicals.
A device applied in the bottling line to seal the mouth of a bottle is termed an external bottle cap, Closure closure, or internal Stopper stopper.
A bottle can also be sealed by a conductive "innerseal" by using induction sealing.The bottle has developed over millennia of use, with some of the earliest examples appearing in China, Phoenicia, Rome and Crete.
Bottles are often recycled according to the SPI recycling code for the material.
