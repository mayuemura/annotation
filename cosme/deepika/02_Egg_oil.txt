Egg oil , also known as egg yolk oil or ovum oil, is derived from the yolk of chicken eggs consisting mainly of triglycerides with traces of lecithin, cholesterol, xanthophylls such as lutein and zeaxanthin and immunoglobulins.
It is free of egg proteins and hence may be used safely by people who are allergic to eggs, for topical applications such as hair and skin care. 
The product has several historical references in Unani (Greek) medicine for hair care. 
Traditional Chinese medicine uses egg oil for burns, eczema, dermatitis, mouth ulcers, skin ulcers, chapped nipples, tinea capitis, ringworm, nasal vestibulitis, frostbite and hemorrhoids.
