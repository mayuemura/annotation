Chlorella is a genus of single-Cell cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta.
It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 Micrometre in diameter, and is without flagella.
Chlorella contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast.
Through photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.
The name Chlorella is taken from the Greek χλώρος, chloros, meaning green, and the Latin diminutive suffix ella, meaning small.
