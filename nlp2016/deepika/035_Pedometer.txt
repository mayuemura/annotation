A pedometer is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the Motion motion of the person's hands or Hip hips.
Because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal calibration, performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies.
Distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a GPS tracker.
Used originally by sports and physical fitness enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday Physical exercise counter and motivator.
Often worn on the belt belt and kept on all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has walked that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps Ã— step length).
