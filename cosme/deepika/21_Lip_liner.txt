Lip liner, also known as lip pencil, is a cosmetic product. 
It is intended to fill uneven areas on the outer edges of the lips after applying lipstick, therefore giving a smooth shape. 
It is also used to outline the lips, keeping lipstick inside the lip area and preventing it from "bleeding", therefore creating a bigger contrast and making the lips stand out more. 
The product is usually sold in a retractable tube or pencil form. 
Lip liner is usually available in the same range of colors as lipsticks: e.g., reds, pinks, browns, plums, etc.
