A finger cot (also finger frock or finger stall, informally finger condom) is a medical supply used to cover one or more fingers in situations where a full glove is unnecessary. Like Medical glove|medical and rubber gloves, finger cots may be made from a variety of water-tight materials including latex, nitrile rubber, and vinyl.

A toe protector or toe cap is very similar, but shorter and of greater diameter. The function is not so much to prevent contamination—toes are normally contained within footwear that protects them—but to protect an injured toe against further damage from friction and pressure by continual rubbing against other toes and the shoe. They are consequently made partly or wholly of  a soft material such as a mineral oil gel, and the end may be either open or closed.
