An ice pack or gel pack is a portable plastic sac filled with water, or refrigerant gel or liquid.
For use the contents are frozen in a freezer.
Both ice and other toxicity|non-toxic refrigerants (mostly water) can absorb a considerable amount of heat before they warm above 0&nbsp;Â°C, due to the high latent heat of fusion of water.
These packs are commonly used to keep food cool in portable coolers, or as a compress (medical)|cold compress to alleviate the pain of minor injuries; or in insulated shipping containers to keep products cool during transport.
