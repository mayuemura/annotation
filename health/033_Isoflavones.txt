Isoflavones are a type of often naturally occurring isoflavonoids, many of which act as phytoestrogens in mammals. Some are termed antioxidants because of their ability to trap singlet oxygen. However, the risk reduction in breast cancer from soy isoflavones was only shown in Asian populations (Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study).

Isoflavones such as genistein and daidzein, may affect the growth of estrogen-receptor positive and negative breast cancer cells in vitro. However, a 2010 meta-analysis of fifteen placebo-controlled studies said that "neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone concentrations in men."

Studies on mice indicate that isoflavones may cause thymic and immune system abnormalities and reduction in immune system activity.
