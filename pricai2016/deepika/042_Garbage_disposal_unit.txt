A garbage disposal unit or waste disposal unit is a device, usually electrically powered, installed under a kitchen sink between the sink's drain drain and the trap trap.
The disposal unit shreds food waste into pieces small enough—generally less than convert 2mm—to pass through plumbing.
In Canada they are commonly known as garburators.
Garbage disposal units are widely used in United States households, but far less commonly used elsewhere.
