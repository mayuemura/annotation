Prebiotics is a general term to refer to substances that induce the growth or activity of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and fungi) that contribute to the well-being of their host.
The most common example is in the gastrointestinal tract, where prebiotics can alter the composition of organisms in the gut microbiome.
However, in principle it is a more general term that can refer to other areas of the body as well.
For example, certain hand moisturizers have been proposed to act as prebiotics to improve the activity or composition of the skin microbiota.
In diet, prebiotics are typically non-digestible dietary fiber compounds that pass undigested through the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the growth or activity of advantageous bacteria that colonize the large bowel by acting as substrate substrate for them.
