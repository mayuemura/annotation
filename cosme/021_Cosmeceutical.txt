Cosmeceuticals refers to the combination of cosmetics  and pharmaceuticals.  Cosmeceuticals are cosmetic products with biologically active ingredients purporting to have medical or drug-like benefits. 

Dermatological research suggests that the bioactive ingredients used in cosmeceuticals have benefits beyond the traditional moisturizer (e.g., Chen et al., 2005; Zettersten, Ghadially, Feingold, Crumrine, & Elias, 1997). However, despite reports of benefits from some cosmeceutical products, there are no requirements to prove that these products live up to their claims. 

The "cosmeceutical" label applies only to products applied topically, such as creams, lotions and ointments.  Products which are similar in perceived benefits but ingested orally are known as nutricosmetics.
