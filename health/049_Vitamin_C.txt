Vitamin C is a cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor in at least eight enzyme|enzymatic reactions, including several collagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy. In animals, these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries. Ascorbate may also act as an antioxidant against oxidative stress. Therefore, unless written otherwise, "ascorbate" and "ascorbic acid" refer in the nutritional literature to <small>L</small>-ascorbate and <small>L</small>-ascorbic acid, respectively. This notation will be followed in this article. Similarly, their oxidized derivatives (dehydroascorbate, etc., see below) are all Enantiomer|<small>L</small>-enantiomers, and also need not be written with full sterochemical notation here.

Ascorbic acid is a weak acid|weak sugar acid structurally related to glucose. In biological systems, ascorbic acid can be found only at low pH, but in neutral solutions above pH 5 is predominantly found in the ionized form, ascorbate. All of these molecules have vitamin C activity, therefore, and are used synonymously with vitamin C, unless otherwise specified.
