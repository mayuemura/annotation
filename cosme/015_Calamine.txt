about|the chemical mixture

Calamine is either a mixture of zinc oxide (ZnO) with about 0.5% iron(III) oxide|ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or a zinc carbonate compound.   It is the main ingredient in calamine lotion and is used as an anti-pruritic (anti-itching agent) to treat conditions such as sunburn, rashes, poison ivy, poison oak, chickenpox, and insect bites and stings. It is also used as a mild antiseptic to prevent infections that can be caused by scratching the affected area, and an astringent to dry weeping or oozing blisters and Acne vulgaris|acne abscesses.
