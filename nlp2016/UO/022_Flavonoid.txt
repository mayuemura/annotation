Flavonoids (or bioflavonoids) (from the Latin word flavus meaning yellow, their color in nature) are a class of plant and fungus secondary metabolites.
Chemically, they have the general structure of a 15-carbon skeleton, which consists of two phenyl rings (A and B) and heterocyclic ring (C).
This carbon structure can be abbreviated C6-C3-C6.
According to the IUPAC nomenclature,they can be classified into:*flavonoids or bioflavonoids*isoflavonoids, derived from chromen-4-one (3-phenyl-1,4-benzopyran|benzopyrone) structure*neoflavonoids, derived from 4-phenylcoumarine (4-phenyl-1,2-benzopyran|benzopyrone) structureThe three flavonoid classes above are all ketone-containing compounds, and as such, are anthoxanthins (flavones and flavonols).
This class was the first to be termed bioflavonoids.
