Lip gloss is a product used primarily to give lips a glossy lustre, and sometimes to add a subtle color. It is distributed as a liquid or a soft solid (not to be confused with lip balm, which generally has medicinal or soothing purposes). The product is available in ranges of Opacity (optics)|opacity from Transparency (optics)|translucent to solid, and can have various frosted, glittered, glossy, and metallic finishes.
