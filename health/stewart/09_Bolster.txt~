A bolster is a long narrow pillow or cushion filled with cotton, down or fibre.
Bolsters are usually firm for back or arm support or for decorative application.
A foam insert is sometimes used for additional support.
A bolster is also referred to as a cushion, a pillow and a prop.
In western countries, a bolster is usually placed at the head of one's bed and functions as head or lower back support, or as an arm support on furniture with high rigid sides.
