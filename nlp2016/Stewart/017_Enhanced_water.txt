Enhanced water is a category of beverages that are marketed as water, but which contain additional ingredients, ranging from natural or artificial flavors, sugar, sweeteners, vitamins, minerals and other "enhancements."
Most enhanced waters are lower in calories per ounce than non-diet soft drinks.
Pepsi and Coca-Cola and other companies market enhanced water.
The marketing of enhanced water usually capitalizes on the healthful image of water combined with the perceived health, taste or functional benefits of one or more additional ingredients.
Vitaminwater contains 33 grams of sugar per bottle, and its maker Coca-Cola is being sued by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
