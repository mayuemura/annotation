An axe (in American English also spelled ax) is an implement that has been used for millennia to shape, split and cut wood; to harvest timber; as a weapon; and as a ceremonial or heraldic symbol.
The axe has many forms and specialised uses but generally consists of an axe head with a handle, or helve.
Before the modern axe, the stone-age hand axe was used from 1.5 million years BP without a handle.
It was later fastened to a wooden handle.
The earliest examples of handled axes have heads of rock stone with some form of wooden handle attached hafted) in a method to suit the available materials and use.
