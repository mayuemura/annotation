A respirator is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling harmful dusts, fumes, vapors, or gases.
Respirators come in a wide range of types and sizes used by the military,
private industry, and the public.
Respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable masks to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges.
There are two main categories: the air-purifying respirator which forces contaminated air through a filtering element, and the air-supplied respirator in which an alternate supply of fresh air is delivered.
