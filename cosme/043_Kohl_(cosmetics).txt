Kohl has also been used in India as a cosmetic for a long time. In addition, mothers would apply kohl to their infants' eyes soon after birth. Some did this to "strengthen the child's eyes", and others believed it could prevent the child from being cursed by the evil eye.

Modern day Salafi Muslims use kohl as it was the practice of Muhammed. Salafis in Egypt do not allow women to venture outside their homes wearing kohl as it makes a woman more attractive.
