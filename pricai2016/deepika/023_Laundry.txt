Laundry is the washing of clothing and linens.
Laundry processes are often done in a room reserved for that purpose; in an individual home this is referred to as a laundry room or utility room.
An apartment building or student hall of residence may have a shared laundry facility such as a tvÃ¤ttstuga.
A stand-alone business is referred to as a laundrette (laundromat).
The material that is being washed, or has been laundered, is also generally referred to as laundry.
