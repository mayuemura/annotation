A finger cot (also finger frock or finger stall, informally finger condom) is a medical supply used to cover one or more fingers in situations where a full glove is unnecessary.
Like medical and rubber gloves, finger cots may be made from a variety of water-tight materials including latex, nitrile rubber, and vinyl.
