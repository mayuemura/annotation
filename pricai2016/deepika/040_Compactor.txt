A compactor is a machine or mechanism used to reduce the size of material such as waste material or bio mass through Soil compaction|compaction. A trash compactor is often used by a home or business to reduce the volume of trash. A baler-wrapper compactor is often used for making compact and wrapped bales in order to improve logistics.Normally powered by hydraulic machinery|hydraulics, compactors take many shapes and sizes. In landfill sites for example, a large bulldozer with spiked wheels called a waste compaction|landfill compactor is used to drive over waste deposited by waste collection vehicles (WCVs).WCVs themselves incorporate a compacting mechanism which is used to increase the payload of the vehicle and reduce the number of times it has to empty. This usually takes the form of hydraulically powered sliding plates which sweep out the collection Chute hopper and compress the material into what has already been loaded.Different compactors are used in scrap metal processing, the most familiar being the car crusher. Such devices can be of either the "pancake" type, where a scrap automobile is flattened by a huge descending hydraulically powered plate, or the Baler#Industrial packaging|baling press, where the automobile is compressed from several directions until it resembles a large cube.
