Eye drops are saline saline-containing Drop drops used as an ocular route to administer.
Depending on the condition being treated, they may contain steroids, antihistamines, sympathomimetics, beta receptor blockers, parasympathomimetics, parasympatholytics, prostaglandins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, Antifungal medication|antifungal, or topical anesthetics.
Eye drops sometimes do not have medications in them and are only lubricating and tear-replacing solutions.
Eye drops have less of a risk of side effects than do oral medicines, and such risk can be minimized by occluding the lacrimal punctum, (i.e. pressing on the inner corner of the eye) for a short while after instilling drops.
