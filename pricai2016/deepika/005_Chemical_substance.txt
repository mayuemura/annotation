A chemical substance is a form of matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic properties.
It cannot be separated into components by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds.
Chemical substances can be chemical elements, chemical compounds, ions or alloys.
Chemical substances are often called 'pure' to set them apart from mixtures.
A common example of a chemical substance is pure Water water; it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory.
