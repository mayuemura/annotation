Althaea is a genus of 6–12 species of perennial herbs native to Europe and western Asia.
It includes Althaea officinalis, also known as the marshmallow plant, whence the fluffy confection got its name.
They are found on the banks of rivers and in salt marshes, preferring moist, sandy soils.
The stems grow to 1–2m tall, and flower in mid summer.
The leaves are palmately lobed with 3–7 lobes.
