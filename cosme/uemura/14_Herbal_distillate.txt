Herbal distillates, also called floral water, hydrosol, hydrolate, herbal water and essential water, are aqueous products of distillation. 
They are colloidal suspensions (hydrosol) of essential oils as well as water-soluble components obtained by steam distillation or hydrodistillation (a variant of steam distillation ) from plants/herbs. 
These herbal distillates have uses as flavorings, medicine and cosmetics (skin care).
Herbal distillates are produced in the same or similar manner as essential oils. 
However, the essential oil will float to the top of the distillate where it is removed, leaving behind the watery distillate.
