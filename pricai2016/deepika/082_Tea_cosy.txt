A tea cosy (American English: tea cozy) or tea warmer is a cover for a teapot, traditionally made of cloth.
It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm.
Their use predates the invention of vacuum bottles as a means of keeping hot liquids hot.
Tea cosies may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed.
Some tea cosies are hand-knitted, resembling woollen hats, some even feature a "bobble"  (pom-pom) on top, which may also serve as a handle to remove or lift the tea cosy.
