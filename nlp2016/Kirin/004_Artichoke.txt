The globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) is a variety of a species of thistle cultivated as a food.
The edible portion of the plant consists of the flower buds before the flowers come into bloom.
The budding artichoke flower-head is a cluster of many budding small flowers (an inflorescence) together with many bracts, on an edible base.
Once the buds bloom, the structure changes to a coarse, barely edible form.
Another variety of the species is the cardoon, a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region.
