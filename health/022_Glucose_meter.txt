A glucose meter (or glucometer) is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood.  It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) by people with diabetes mellitus or  hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained by pricking the skin with a Blood lancet|lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dl or Mmol/L|mmol/l.

Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus|type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day.  The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of Diabetes mellitus#Long-term complications|long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of diabetic hypoglycemia|hypoglycemia.
