Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of epigynous berries from the Coffea plant.
The Coffea plant is native to subtropical Africa and some islands in southern Asia.
The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world and coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.
The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta.
Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried.
