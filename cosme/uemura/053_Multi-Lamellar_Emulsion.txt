Multi-Lamellar Emulsion (MLE) is an oil-in-water emulsion|oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion showing multi-lamellar structure and an original technology developed by NeoPharm in South Korea.
MLE is made with NeoPharm's proprietary pseudoceramide PC-9S. 
Lamellar structure, also observed in stratum corneum, is defined as a thin plate or membrane of skin lipids. 
MLE shows multiple layers of this lamellar structure, and as a moisturizer, MLE offers long-lasting skin moisturizing effects through reinforcing the skin's natural barrier function.
As an Oil-in-water emulsion|O/W emulsion, MLE can be also used as a vehicle (carrier) for topical drugs.
