A dishwasher is a mechanical device for cleaning dishes and eating-utensils.
Dishwashers can be found in restaurants and private homes.
Unlike manual dishwashing, which relies largely on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water, typically between convert 55 and 75 Â°C, at the dishes, with lower temperatures used for delicate items.
A mix of water and detergent is circulated by a pump.
Water is pumped to one or more rotating spray arms, which blast the dishes with the cleaning mixture.
