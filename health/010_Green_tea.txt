Green tea is made from Camellia sinensis leaves that have undergone minimal Tea processing|oxidation during processing. Green tea originated in China, but has become known for many countries in East Asia.

Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially due to growing conditions, horticulture, production processing, and time of harvest.
