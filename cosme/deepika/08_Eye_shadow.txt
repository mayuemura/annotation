Eye shadow is a cosmetic that is applied on the eyelids and under the eyebrows. 
It is commonly used to make the wearer's eyes stand out or look more attractive.
Eye shadow can add depth and dimension to one's eyes, complement the eye color, or simply draw attention to the eyes. 
Eye shadow comes in many different colors and textures. 
It is usually made from a powder and mica, but can also be found in liquid, pencil, or mousse form.
