Aloe vera  is a succulent plant species.
Extracts from Aloe vera are widely used in the cosmetics and alternative medicine industries, being marketed as variously having rejuvenating, healing, or soothing properties.
There is, however, little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes, and what positive evidence is available is frequently contradicted by other studies.
Non-decolorized aloe vera leaf extract has been flagged as a possible carcinogenic by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard OEHHA, along with goldenseal.
