Keratolytic IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɛr|ə|t|ɵ|ˈ|l|ɪ|t|ɨ|k therapy is treatment to remove warts and other lesions in which the Epidermis (skin)|epidermis produces excess skin. In this therapy, acid medicine, such as salicylic acid is put on the lesion. Keratolytic therapy thins the skin on and around the lesion. It causes the outer layer of the skin to loosen and shed.

Keratolytics can also be used to soften keratin, a major component of the skin.  This serves to improve the skin's moisture binding capacity, which is beneficial in the treatment of dry skin.  Such agents (keratolytics) include urea, lactic acid, and allantoin. Urea acts as a keratolytic due to its hygroscopic property.
