Lip gloss is a product used primarily to give lips a glossy lustre, and sometimes to add a subtle color. 
It is distributed as a liquid or a soft solid (not to be confused with lip balm, which generally has medicinal or soothing purposes). 
The product is available in ranges of opacity from translucent to solid, and can have various frosted, glittered, glossy, and metallic finishes.
