A mirror is an object that Reflection reflects light in such a way that, for incident light in some range of wavelengths, the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light.
This is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light.
The most familiar type of mirror is the plane mirror, which has a flat screen surface.
Curved mirrors are also used, to produce magnified or diminished images or focus light or simply distort the reflected image.
Mirrors are commonly used for personal grooming or admiring oneself (in which case the archaic term looking-glass is sometimes still used), decoration, and architecture.
