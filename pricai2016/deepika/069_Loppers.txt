Loppers are a type of scissors used for pruning twigs and small branches, like secateurs with very long handles.
They are the largest type of manual garden cutting tool.
They are usually operated with two hands, and with handles typically between 30 centimetres (12 in) & 91 centimetres (36 in) long to give good leverage.
Some have telescopic handles which can be extended to a length of two metres, in order to increase leverage and to reach high branches on a tree.
Loppers are mainly used for the pruning of tree branches with diameters less than 5 centimetres (2 in).
