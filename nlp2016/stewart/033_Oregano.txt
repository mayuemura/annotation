Oregano is a common species of Origanum, a genus of the mint family (Lamiaceae).
It is native to warm-temperate western and southwestern Eurasia and the Mediterranean region.
Oregano is a perennial herb, growing from 20–80cm tall, with opposite leaves 1–4cm long.
Oregano will grow in a pH range between 6.0 (mildly acidic) and 9.0 (strongly alkaline) with a preferred range between 6.0 and 8.0. The flowers are purple, 3–4mm long, produced in erect spikes.
It is sometimes called wild marjoram, and its close relative O. majorana is known as sweet marjoram.
