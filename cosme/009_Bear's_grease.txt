Bear's grease was a popular treatment for men with hair loss from at least as early as 1653 until about the First World War. The myth of its effectiveness is based on a belief that as bears are very hairy, their fat would assist hair growth in others. Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), Benedictine mystic, composer and woman of letters, also recommended the use of the substance in her Physica (repeated in her Causae et Curae). A number of cosmetics companies sold bear's grease and it was a trademark of Atkinsons of London who sold "Bears Grease Pomade".
