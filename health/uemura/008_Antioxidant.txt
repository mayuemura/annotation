An antioxidant is a molecule that inhibits the Redox|oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction involving the loss of electrons which can produce Radical (chemistry)|free radicals.  In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions.  When the chain reaction occurs in a cell (biology)|cell, it can cause damage or death to the cell.  Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions.
