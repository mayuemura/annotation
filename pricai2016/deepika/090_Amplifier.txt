An amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal.
It does this by taking energy from a power supply and controlling the output to match the input signal shape but with a larger amplitude.
In this sense, an amplifier modulates the output of the power supply to make the output signal stronger than the input signal.
An amplifier is effectively the opposite of an attenuator attenuator: while an amplifier provides gain gain, an attenuator provides loss.
An amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit within another device.
