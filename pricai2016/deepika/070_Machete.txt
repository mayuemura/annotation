A machete is a large Cleaver cleaver-like knife.
The blade is typically 32.5 to 45 centimetres (12.8 to 17.7 in) long and usually under 3 millimeters (0.12 in) thick.
In the Spanish language, the word is a diminutive form of the word macho, which means male or strong and was used to refer to sledgehammers.
In the English language, an equivalent term is matchet, though it is less commonly known.
In the English-speaking Caribbean, such as Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Grenada and in Trinidad and Tobago, the term "cutlass" is used for these agricultural tools.
