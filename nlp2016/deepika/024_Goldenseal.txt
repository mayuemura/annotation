Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), also called orangeroot or yellow puccoon, is a perennial herb in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to southeastern Canada and the eastern United States.
It may be distinguished by its thick, yellow knotted rootstock.
The stem is purplish and hairy above ground and yellow below ground where it connects to the yellow rhizome.
The plant bears two palmate, hairy leaves with 5–7 double-toothed lobes and single, small, inconspicuous flowers with greenish white stamens in the late spring.
It bears a single berry like a large raspberry with 10–30 seeds in the summer.
