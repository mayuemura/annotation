Fish oil is oil derived from the tissues of oily fish.
Fish oils contain the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), precursors of certain eicosanoids that are known to reduce inflammation in the body, and have other health benefits.
Nonetheless, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes.
Fish oil is used as a component in aquaculture feed.
More than 50 percent of the world's fish oil used in aquaculture feed is fed to farmed salmon.
