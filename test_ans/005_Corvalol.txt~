Corvalol (Корвалол, Corvalolum Korvalol) is a mild tranquilizer based on valerian (herb) root and phenobarbital, popular in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as a "heart medication". It is available as a transparent liquid with a characteristic strong aroma, and as white bi-concave scored tablets. While not available for sale in the Western countries, Corvalol is sometimes brought over from Eastern Europe for self-administration to other countries of residence. Corvalol contains documented amounts of psychoactive chemicals, and may interact with other prescription medications that a person is taking.
