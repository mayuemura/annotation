A lipase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fats (lipids).
Lipases are a subclass of the esterases.
Lipases perform essential roles in the digestion, transport and processing of dietary lipids (e.g. triglycerides, fats, oils) in most, if not all, living organisms.
Genes encoding lipases are even present in certain viruses.
Most lipases act at a specific position on the glycerol backbone of lipid substrate (A1, A2 or A3)(small intestine).
