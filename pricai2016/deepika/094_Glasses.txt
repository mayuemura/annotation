Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are devices consisting of lens lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's Human eyes.
Glasses are typically used for vision correction.
Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris or against visible and near-visible light or radiation.
Sunglasses allow better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from high levels of ultraviolet light.
Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information (such as stereoscopy).
