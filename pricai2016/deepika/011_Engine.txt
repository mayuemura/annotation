An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into Motion mechanical energy.
Heat engines, including internal combustion engines and external combustion engines (such as steam engines), burn a fuel to create heat, which then creates a force.
Electric motors convert electrical energy into machine mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and others—such as clockwork motors in wind-up toys—use elastic energy.
In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion.
