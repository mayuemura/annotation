iFood (isotopic food) contains nutritients in which some atoms are replaced with their heavier non-radioactive isotopes (such as 13C and 2H, derived from C4 carbon C4-plants).
Biomolecules that incorporate heavier isotopes give rise to more stable molecular structures with increased resistance to damages associated with ageing.
The inclusion of heavy isotopes might be either active (selection for heavier isotopes) or passive (incorporation reflecting the existing abundance).
Consumption of foods relatively rich in heavy isotopes, especially at the early stages of the organism's development, is linked, so far hypothetically, with enhanced longevity.
Consumed with food,some biomolecules (e.g., essential amino acids) become building material for the human cells.
