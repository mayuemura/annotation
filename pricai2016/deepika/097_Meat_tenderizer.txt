A meat tenderizer, meat mallet, or meat pounder is a hand-powered tool used to tenderize slabs of meat in preparation for cooking.
Although a meat tenderizer can be made out of virtually any object, there are three types manufactured specifically for tenderizing meat.
The first, most common, is a tool that resembles a hammer or mallet made of metal or wood with a short handle and dual heads.
One face of the tool is usually flat while the other has rows of pyramid-shaped tenderizers.
The second form resembles a potato masher with a short handle and a large metal face that is either smooth or adorned with the same pyramid-shaped tenderizers as found in the first form.
