Tweezers are small tools used for picking up objects too small to be easily handled with the human hands.
They are probably derived from tongs, Pincer pincers, or scissors-like pliers used to grab or hold hot objects since the dawn of recorded history.
In a scientific or medical context they are normally referred to as forceps.
Tweezers make use of two third-class levers connected at one fixed end (the fulcrum point of each lever), with the pincers at the others.
Women commonly use tweezers mainly for tasks such as plucking hair from the face or eyebrows, often using the term eyebrow tweezers.
